# Cross-compiling Firefox for armhf with clang (trusty)

The main **README.md** describes how to cross-compile from an amd64
Debian Stretch container. Read that first, then for specifics on
building for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty see these add-on notes. A Trusty
binary is the most portable (run it on Xenial or even Stretch).

Instead of adding Bionic sources, make sure your existing sources.list
contains the expected Trusty ports.

    deb [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty main restricted
    deb-src [arch=armhf]  http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty main restricted
    deb [arch=armhf]  http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty-updates main restricted
    deb-src [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty-updates main restricted
    deb [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty universe
    deb-src [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty universe
    deb [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty-updates universe
    deb-src [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty-updates universe
    deb [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty multiverse
    deb-src [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty multiverse
    deb [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty-updates multiverse
    deb-src [arch=armhf] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ trusty-updates multiverse

Then sudo apt update and install the many packages listed in README in addition
to **rustup** and **node** version 11.

Python 3.4 is the default on Trusty, but Firefox's build process requires 3.5 or newer.

    sudo apt install python3.5

We can use the same big patchfile used for Stretch:

    patch -p1 < path/to/firefox-armhf/armhf.patch

For clang to use old gcc headers, you must apply a *system-level* libstdc++ patch:

    (cd / && sudo patch -p1 < path/to/firefox-armhf/gcc-4.8-trusty.patch)

Get Firefox source:

    apt-get source firefox:armhf
    cd firefox-*

Build:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/pkgconfig \
      CONFIG_SITE=/etc/dpkg-cross/cross-config.amd64 \
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck \
      dpkg-buildpackage -aarmhf -b -d

After configuration errors, replace mozconfig with `mozconfig.trusty`
and edit paths. It's similar to the included mozconfig except s/6.3.0/4.8.4/

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/pkgconfig \
      CONFIG_SITE=/etc/dpkg-cross/cross-config.amd64 \
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck \
      dpkg-buildpackage -aarmhf -b -d -nc

This will likely encounter the shlibsign error so work around that
just as described in **README.md**.

The final build step might complain about missing files from debian/tmp, which
is frustrating as the build process nukes the tmp subfolder. To get past that,
try pausing with Ctrl+Z followed by:

    mkdir -p debian/tmp/usr/lib
    cp -rpf obj-arm-linux-gnueabihf/dist/* debian/tmp/usr/lib

Then bring the incremental build back into the foreground with:

    fg
